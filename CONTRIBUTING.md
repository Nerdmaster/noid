# How to Contribute

Think NOIDs are the shit?  Help me make this the best noid codebase EVER!!1!

## Reporting Issues

Submit a [Github issue](./issues) if you're too damn lazy to actually do code.
I'm cool with that.  I'm lazy, too.  In fact, I doubt I'll ever finish this
project!

But when you submit an issue, please remember to GoDEEP:

* **D**escribe the problem in words a non-metadata-expert can understand
* **E**xplain what is happening that you consider incorrect
* **E**xplain what you expected to have happen
* **P**rovide steps to reproduce what you perceive as the problem

(**Go** is part of the acronym because it's the language of choice.  I
shouldn't have to explain that, but well... my target audience and all....)

## What's yours is mine

If you commit stuff, it better be stuff you don't mind giving up, because once
it's here, it's part of the project, and licensed as such.

The current license is [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](./LICENSE.txt).
If you contribute, your work is effectively PUBLIC DOMAIN.

If you commit with any obvious non-personal email address I'll probably reject
your commit.  Chances are it's not your property if you code it AT WORK.

## git-flow

I use [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).  If you want to contribute,
you'll use it, too.  Feature branches start with "feature/".  All pull requests
must be based on the "develop" branch.

If you make a branch off master, I may or may not accept it, but it definitely
won't have your name on it.

## Commit messages

I follow Tim Pope's guidelines for [good commit
practices](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
You will, too, if you want your commit to not be rewritten by me.

In case the good Pope's site goes down, hereâ€™s a model git commit message:

```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
```

Don't like it?  Go elsewhere.

## Workflow

* Fork the repository
* Create a nice workspace:
  * `go get github.com/Nerdmaster/noid`
  * `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Nerdmaster/noid`
  * `git remote rename origin upstream`
  * `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOURNAME/noid.git`
  * `git pull origin develop`
  * Don't blame me, this is due to the insanity of what could have been a good
    language.  Go discourages local importing of packages, opting instead for
    basically URLs.  Makes it lovely when a project needs to move, I'd bet.
* Create a topic branch *based on develop*
  * I like hyphens and all lowercase for branch names.  You want to contribute?
    Then you do, too.  `feature/foo-bar`, not `feature/FooBar`
* Make commits of logical units.
  * If you follow the lunacy of "one commit per pull request", and your PR is
    non-trivial, I will not only not accept your work, but I'll comment on it
    as if I'm going to accept it, wasting as much of your time as I possibly
    can.  I may even steal some of it and put it into the project while leaving
    your PR up in a state of perpetual "code review".
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
  Whitespace changes must be in their own commit, and whitespace errors will
  not be tolerated.
  * Consider using `gofmt`.  Yes, I hate its choices, too, but it's a standard,
    and it's easy to adopt and use.
* If you created an issue, you can close it by including "Closes #issue" in
  your commit message. See [Github's blog post for more
  details](https://github.com/blog/1386-closing-issues-via-commit-messages)
* Make sure you have added tests if it seems appropriate to do so
* Run *all* the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken
