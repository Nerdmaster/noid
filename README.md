C, noid, Go!  Go, noid, Go!

This is my attempt to make an awful system at least a little more sensible.
NOIDs certainly have their place in very specific situations, but overall...
I'm underwhelmed.

But if folks are gonna do this, they should have an option that doesn't force a
specific language on you (i.e., something that can just run as a standalone
binary), and is an **actual** micro-service (writing a Ruby *library* and
calling it a micro-service doesn't count, guys).

**NOTE**: I have no idea if I'll ever actually use C in this project, but I
couldn't just *not* use that title.  It would be criminal.
